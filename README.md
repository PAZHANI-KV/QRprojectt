Respected Sir/Madam,

Thanks to giving me an oppurtunity to showcase my skillset.

Within a short given span of time, I could complete only a part of the project and the code for both the frontend and backed is attached as client and server in this file.

I created a Registration page for students signup which will redirect them to a dedicated student portal page and at the sametime, there is another dedicated dashboard page 
created for the admin which can be accessed by using the dedicated login id of admin.

Had an idea of implementing crud in admin page which will guide the changes in student page too. But due to time constrain I couldn't able to complete it.

I hope this code snippet which I attached in this file will showcase my technical skillset to you.

Thanks for the oppurtunity.
